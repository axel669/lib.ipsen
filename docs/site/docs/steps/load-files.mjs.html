<h1 id="markdown-extensions">Markdown Extensions</h1>
<p>Ipsen has added a couple of shorthands to allow embedding extra information in
the markdown comments without cluttering them.</p>
<h2 id="sidebar-path">Sidebar Path</h2>
<p><code>[@] &lt;Path&gt;</code> can be used to tell Ipsen to use a specific sidebar path instead of
generating one from the file location. Write as a normal path using <code>/</code> to
delimit the expandable sections, and <code>//</code> can be used as an escape sequence to
put a &quot;/&quot; into the sidebar item label.</p>
<h2 id="yaml-embeds">YAML Embeds</h2>
<p>Using <code>{yaml}</code> at the start of a paragraph will allow the remaining lines to be
interpreted as yaml and used to embed iframe previews and code examples from
files.</p>
<p>iframe examples will be embedded if the <code>frame</code> property is defined in the yaml.
The examples are loaded from the directory in <code>config.frames</code>. iframes are 300px
tall by default, but can be changed by defining a <code>height</code> property in the yaml.</p>
<p>Code examples will be read from files inside the directory in <code>config.examples</code>
and embedded if the <code>code</code> property is defined.</p>
<p>If a single yaml block has both <code>frame</code> and <code>code</code> defined, the iframe will be
shown as normal, but will include a toggle to show the code overlaid on top of
the frame.</p>
