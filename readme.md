# Ipsen

A static site generator that aims to be simple and powerful.

> âš  this documentation is very limited while more testing is going on.
> More comprehensive documentation will be available when Ipsen is closer to
> a production release.

## Installation
```bash
pnpm add @axel669/ipsen
```

## Usage
Ipsen uses a `.ipsen` folder in project root to determine configuration and
other things (see below).
```bash
npx ipsen
```
That's really it. All the configuration and custom files are read from the
`.ipsen` folder.

## .ipsen Folder
The `config.yml` file is the only file required by ipsen. The other folders are
optional, and only used when rendering from custom templates/parsers.

If the data folder is present, the files will be loaded from it using the
parsers configured in the config and loaded into `$.data[<filename>]` for the
templates to use.
```
project
    .ipsen
        config.yml
        parser
        static
        template
            page.html
            vars.json
            static
            <other template files>
    <project files>
```

### config.yml
```yml
# The source markdown file that lists the contents of the site.
source: site.md
# The folder to save the generated files into.
dest: site
# Custom parsers for loading data out of files and into marked areas to make api
# documentation easier, and allowing the api docs to stay in the code files.
# Parsers starting with "@" will be loaded from the parsers available in Ipsen.
# Each extension needs to be configured individually even if they use the same
# parser.
parsers:
  mjs: "@js"
  js: "@js"
  cjs: "@js"
  py: "@py"
  yaml: "@yaml"
  json: "@json"
# The name of the template to use for generating the site. Names starting with
# "@" will resolve to the templates provided by ipsen, any other name will be
# resolved in the .ipsen/template folder in the project.
# The template will always load the page.html file from the template folder and
# use it to render the pages of the site.
template: "@basic"
# extra options available to the template as $.options. Any type of value allowed.
options:
  theme: dark
```

> The `.ipsen` folder and the `source`/`dest` options of the config are relative
> to the cwd where Ipsen is being run.

### site.md
The `site.md` file should list the contents of the site that need to be rendered
and will also serve to build the sidebar menu for site navigation. Links will
determine which files are rendered (and their titles), and text can be used to
name any section of files in the list without rendering content at that point.

Only one link should be outside of a list, and it will be used as the index
file for the site. All files except the index will generate an html file of the
same name with the extension changed. The index file will always be saved as
`index.html` to allow standard website configurations to play nice with the
rendered content.

> Currently Ipsen assumes the static site will be at the root of the domain
> it's hosted at, so all paths are `/<file>` within the html to make sure that
> any file can link to any othe file without needing to calculate the relative
> path between every file and every other file in the output.
